# MEP-804: Reward Token Contract

## Simple Summary
The MEP-804 Reward Token Contract is a smart contract that can create, distribute, and administer reward tokens. These token are used to reward users for connecting sensors and taking part in other ecosystem-wide activities.

## Abstract
The MEP-804 Reward Token Contract is intended to make it possible for users and sensors within the ecosystem to share and claim reward tokens in an efficient manner. To guarantee compatibility and consistency among many applications that implement the Reward Calculation Ecosystem, it adheres to the rules outlined in this specification.

## Motivation
The MEP-804 Reward Token Contract was created primarily to establish a standardized method for managing reward tokens within the ecosystem. This standard contract enables uniform and predictable interactions between various applications and smart contracts and the reward token. As a result, incentives may be earned and transparently redeemed across a wide range of use cases in a single ecosystem.

## Terminology
- Reward Tokens: Digital tokens issued as incentives for users and sensors participating in the ecosystem.
- MEP-804: The smart contract implementing the Reward Token Contract standard.
- ERC20: The Ethereum token standard that MEP-804 complies with.
- Fuel tank - coefficient of "mining power"; calculated as the ratio between the address' current balance and total accumulated balance
fuel_tank = (currentBal / accumulatedBal) * 100
- Pool - allocation of tokens from which particular rewards will be distributed

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every MEP-804 compliant contract must implement the `ERC20` interface:

```solidity=
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

/// @title MEP-804 Reward Token Contract
interface IMEP804 /* is IERC20 */ {
  /// @notice Gets fired when the reward formula is set up
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  event FormularSetup(address _appContractAddress)

  /// @notice Gets fired when reward is submitted
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  /// @param caller the msg.sender
  event RewardSubmitted(address _appContractAddress, address _sensorDataContractAddress, address caller);

  /// @notice Gets fired when reward is claimed
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  /// @param claimer the beneficiary
  event claimRewardClaimed(address _appContractAddress, address _sensorDataContractAddress, address claimer)

  // Formula Setup
  /// @notice Sets up the reward formula and its parameters for the application
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  /// @param _formulaMetadata JSON format metadata containing formula parameters
  function setupFormula(address _appContractAddress, string memory _formulaMetadata) external;

  /// @notice Adds a sensor profile specific to an application and tier
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  /// @param _tier Tier of the sensor profile
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  function addSensorProfile(address _appContractAddress, uint256 _tier, address _sensorDataContractAddress) external;

  // Submit Rewards
  /// @notice Submits the data of the end users and calculates the rewards
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  /// @param _minableData JSON format data sent by the sensor
  function submitRewards(address _appContractAddress, address _sensorDataContractAddress, string memory _minableData) external;

  // Claim Rewards
  /// @notice Allows the end user to claim their earned rewards
  /// @param _appContractAddress Contract address of the application
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  function claimRewards(address _appContractAddress, address _sensorDataContractAddress) external;


  /// @notice Calculates the health factor based on the sensor's fuel and fuel tank size
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  /// @return The health factor
  function calculateHealth(address _sensorDataContractAddress) external view returns (uint256);

  /// @notice Calculates the mining power of the sensor for the current cycle
  /// @param _sensorDataContractAddress Contract address of the sensor data
  /// @param _minableData JSON format data sent by the sensor
  /// @return The mining power
  function calculateMiningPower(address _sensorDataContractAddress, string memory _minableData) external view returns (uint256);
}

interface IERC20 {
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);

    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);

    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    function balanceOf(address _account) external view returns (uint256);

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) external returns (bool);

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) external view returns (uint256);

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _amount) external returns (bool);

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) external returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

The MEP-804 Reward Token Contract standard is designed to ensure  compatibility and uniformity across diverse applications. Developers that follow this standard can design interoperable smart contracts, facilitating smooth reward token distribution and claiming procedures. The ERC20 compliance also enables simple integration with already-existing wallets and applications that are based on Ethereum. In general, the MEP-804 standard helps to create a vibrant and financially rewarding ecosystem for users, sensors, and application developers.
