# MEP-803: Sensor Data Contract

## Simple Summary

Specification that allows the application owner (MEP-801) to create device profiles and link profiles to devices.

## Abstract

## Motivation

## Terminology

- Sensor Profile - Goes to Chirpstack VM
  - Decode function
  - IoT Parameter
  - Custom Parameter
  - Freq
- Custom Parameter
  - The Chirpstack VM publish the data in the reward call
  - Goes inside the sensor NFT (on-chain data)
  - Is claimed in the MEP805

The reward calculation should be done on Chirpstack VM
MEP805 is to claim the rewards, not to calculate rewards (off-chain worker)

(there is an opportunity to remove MEP805 if the claim is done on MEP804)

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every MEP-803 compliant contract must implement the following interface:

```solidity=
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

/// @title MEP-803 Provisioning Contract
interface IMEP803 {
  /// @notice Gets fired when the sensor profile
  ///  is deployed
  event SensorProfileDeployed(address indexed _appContractAddress, string indexed _profileURI);

}
```

## Rationale

To create an application in Sensor Profile, the profile is created at the point of deployment and event is emitted containing the sensor profile contract address, application contract address and sensor profile link.


Prior to the deploying SensorProfile contract, the deployer needs to upload the device profile JSON on a distributed storage (IPFS) and supply the IPFS link to the method.
