# MEP-803: Device Profile Contract

## Simple Summary

Specification that allows the application owner (MEP-801) to create device profiles and link profiles to devices.

## Abstract

## Motivation

## Terminology

- Device Profile - Goes to Chirpstack VM
  - Decode function
  - IoT Parameter
  - Custom Parameter
  - Freq
- Custom Parameter
  - The Chirpstack VM publish the data in the reward call
  - Goes inside the sensor NFT (on-chain data)
  - Is claimed in the MEP805

The reward calculation should be done on Chirpstack VM
MEP805 is to claim the rewards, not to calculate rewards (off-chain worker)

(there is an opportunity to remove MEP805 if the claim is done on MEP804)

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every MEP-803 compliant contract must implement the following interface:

```solidity=
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

/// @title MEP-803 Device Profile
interface IIMEP803 {
    /// @dev This event gets emitted when a device profile added
    ///  The parameters is the index of profile, owner and name.
    event ProfileCreated(uint256 idx, address owner, string name, string url);

    /// @dev This event gets emitted when a device profile renamed
    ///  The parameters is the index of app, owner and name.
    event ProfileRenamed(uint256 idx, address owner, string name);

    /// @dev This event gets emitted when a device profile url changed
    ///  The parameters is the index of app, owner and url.
    event ProfileUrlChanged(uint256 idx, address owner, string url);

    /// @notice Return the name of contract, use to identiry the version of the contract
    function name() external view returns (string memory);

    /// @notice Create a device profile
    /// @param _name The name of of the device profile
    function createProfile(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _url
    ) external returns (uint256);

    /// @notice rename a device profile
    /// @param _idx The device profile index
    /// @param _name The name of of the device profile
    function renameProfile(uint256 _idx, string memory _name) external;

    /// @notice Set the url of the device profile
    /// @param _idx The device profile index
    /// @param _url The url of of the device profile
    function setProfileUrl(uint256 _idx, string memory _url) external;

    /// @notice Return the number of profiles belong to the sender.
    function ownerProfileIdxCount() external view returns (uint256);
}
```



And this public accessible state values:

```
struct DeviceProfile {
    string name;
    address owner;
    string url;
    bool active;
}

contract Storage1 {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;

    /// @notice Device Profile list
    mapping(uint256 => DeviceProfile) public deviceProfileList;
    Counters.Counter public deviceProfileCount;

    /// @notice Device Profile idx list for each owner
    mapping(address => uint256[]) public ownerProfileIdxList;
}
```



## Rationale

To create a Device Profile in ISO Application, the profile is created at the point of calling the `createProfile()` interface and event is emitted containing the device profile index, device profile name, business owner address and the URL.


Prior to the creating a Device Profile, the business owner (BO) needs to ready the device profile JSON file on a reliable internet storage (unauthorised accessible via HTTP or HTTPS). Then the BO could provides the URL when creating the device profile.
