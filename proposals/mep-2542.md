# MEP-2542: Multi-Token Mining for MEP-1004 Radio Miners

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a mechanism for MEP-1004 radio miners to engage in multi-token mining, anchored on the concept of MEP-1002 hexagons. It defines the rules and conditions under which these miners can claim rewards, and the operational parameters which influence the mining capabilities.

## Motivation

Given the limited resource capacity of each MEP-1002 hexagon, there's a need to regulate and allocate mining resources efficiently. This MEP aims to achieve this balance, setting a cycle of 489,600 blocks to minimize resource competition. Further, with the introduction of the Low-Scale-Certification, a new token mining potential of up to 10x has been identified, necessitating the establishment of clear rules.

## Specification

1. **Hexagon Operational Time**: Each MEP-1004 will have a limited operational time within a MEP-1002 hexagon. Once an interaction via MEP-2542 is initiated using MEP-1004, a count of 489,600 blocks is set. Upon reaching this limit, the MEP-1004 will be removed from the MEP-1002 due to slot limitations.

2. **Reward Claiming**: During the period of 489,600 blocks, radio miner manufacturers must introduce a reward-claiming function. This function will allow MEP-1004 miners to claim MXC tokens from the LPWAN contract treasury.

3. **Token Choice Before Consensus**: Prior to the formation of a miner consensus group in Low-Scale-Certification, MEP-1004 miners can choose up to 2 tokens to mine. Additionally, they have the flexibility to change their token preference every epoch (epoch duration to be defined).

4. **MXC Mining Limitation**: MXC is the exclusive token that can be mined for 489,600 blocks due to its limited quantity in the LPWAN treasury. For other tokens, mining can resume if MEP-1004 re-enters a MEP-1002 hexagon for another 489,600-block cycle.

5. **Token Mining Cap**: Every new token introduced has a daily mining cap of 100,000 tokens. This amount will be distributed amongst the MEP-1004 miners based on their respective fuel tank capacities. Governance decisions hold the authority to adjust this cap as necessary.

6. **MXC Scarcity Maintenance**: Upon claiming MXC, 3% of the claimed tokens will be burnt to ensure the scarcity of MXC is preserved.

## Rationale

- **489,600 Block Cycle**: Starting from a cycle of 489,600 blocks provides a balanced approach to resource competition, ensuring that no miner monopolizes a hexagon, thereby promoting fairness in resource allocation.

- **Token Mining Cap**: The cap of 100,000 tokens for new introductions takes into account the capabilities introduced by the Low-Scale-Certification design. This design magnifies the mining potential by 10 times. By setting an initial cap, we aim to stimulate miners to expand, validate, and cover more areas, thereby promoting the decentralization and reach of the network.

## Backward Compatibility

This proposal doesn't introduce backward incompatibilities with existing standards. However, manufacturers and miners will need to adjust to the new regulations and integrate the necessary functions to claim rewards.

## Implementation

Further technical details, including possible code snippets or detailed flow mechanisms, should be added in this section to guide developers and manufacturers.
