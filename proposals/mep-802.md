# MEP-802: Provisioning Contract

## Simple Summary

Specification allows user to create and manage the PID NFTs (Provisioning ID) which are the digital representation of the sensor devices.

## Abstract

Each sensor device is provisioned on the ChirpVM with a help of a NFT. The NFT is a digital representation of the device and contains all the information needed by the ChirpVM to successufly establish a LPWAN communication channel. The ownership of the device is claimed by the ownership of the NFT.

In regards to the above, the MEP-802 proposal will extend the ERC721 interface.

## Motivation

The goal is to allow user to create, add and manage sensor devices as NFTs.

## Terminology

- PID - Provision ID
- BO - Business Owner; the entity that created the application
- Sensor Owner - entity owning the physical sensor device

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every MEP-802 compliant contract must implement the ERC721 interface:

## Rationale

### Sensor validity

The sensor NFT validity acts as a way of constraining outdated (or not active) sensors. Each sensor has to have a expiration time (calculated in block height). When the current block height reaches the expiration block, the sensor is considered to be inactive. The end-user can renew the sensor by paying a fee proportional to the specified `expirationBlock` parameter.

### Front-running attack

When the device owner gets the sensor physically, he needs to claim the NFT by calling the `claim` method with the PID from the device's QR code.

A malicious observer looking at the pending TX pool can spot the claim transaction with the correct PID and replay the transaction with a higher gas price, effectively stealing the NFT from the original owner.

One potential way of preventing this is to implement a proper pre-commit scheme.

An implementer can introduce a `commitment` method which maps the `msg.sender` to a precommit hash:

`mapping(address => bytes) commitments;`

The precommit hash could be `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(PID, msg.sender))`.

Afterwards, when `claim` gets called, the method checks if there exists a matching hash for the given msg.sender.

```solidity
function claimDevice(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _expirationBlock, bytes _pid) {
    bytes commitment = commitments[msg.sender];
    bytes hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_pid, msg.sender));
    require(commitment == hash);
    ...
}
```
