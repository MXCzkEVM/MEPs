# MEP-802: Provisioning Contract

## Simple Summary

Specification allows user to create and manage the PID NFTs (Provisioning ID) which are the digital representation of the sensor devices.

## Abstract

Each sensor device is provisioned on the ChirpVM with a help of a NFT. The NFT is a digital representation of the device and contains all the information needed by the ChirpVM to successufly establish a LPWAN communication channel. The ownership of the device is claimed by the ownership of the NFT.

In regards to the above, the MEP-802 proposal will extend the ERC721 interface.

## Motivation

The goal is to allow user to create, add and manange sensor devices as NFTs.

## Terminology

- PID - Provision ID
- DevEUI - Device Extended Unique Identifier
- BO - Business Owner; the entity that created the application
- Sensor Owner - entity owning the physical sensor device

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every MEP-802 compliant contract must implement the ERC721 interface:

```solidity=
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

/// @title MEP-802 Provisioning Contract
interface MEP802 /* is IERC721 */ {
    /// @dev This event gets emitted when a PID is produced.
    ///  The parameters are the email, amount and Application contract address.
    event PIDProduced(string indexed _email, uint256 indexed _amount, address indexed _applicationContractAddress);

    /// @dev This event gets emitted when a PID is produced.
    ///  The parameters are tokenID, devEUI, pIDHash, and address of lpwanContract
    event SensorNFTMinted(uint256 indexed _tokenID, bytes indexed devEUI, bytes indexed pIDHash, address lpwanContract);

    /// @notice Produce the PID, the PID will be sent to the email given
    /// @param _email The email to receive the PID
    /// @param _amount The amount of the PID
    /// @param _applicationContractAddress The contract address of the application
    function _producePID(string memory _email, uint256 _amount, address _applicationContractAddress) external;

    /// @notice Mint a sensor NFT
    /// @dev The tokenID should be generated on-chain
    /// @param _pIDHash The email to recieve the PID
    /// @param _devEUI The amount of the PID
    /// @param _tokenURI The uri that will be associated with the token
    function mintSensorNFT(bytes _pIDHash, bytes _devEUI, address _applicationContractAddress, string memory _tokenURI) external;

    /// @notice Renews the validity of the device
    /// @dev This method extends the validity period of the sensor.
    ///  This method takes in the pIDHashEVM (depends on which hash function chain is using), then match the NFT with the pIDHashEVM.
    ///  This method will check whether the user who calls this renew function is the owner of the NFT
    ///  This method will check whether the user has enough balance to finish this operation
    ///  For more info check the rationale.
    /// @param _pIDHashEVM the pID EVM Hash gotten from pID
    function renewDevice(bytes _pIDHashEVM) external payable;

    /// @notice Claims an NFT by transferring it to the caller
    /// @dev This method calculates the hash of the _pid
    ///  and checks if it's the same on the NFT.
    ///  If correct, the NFT gets transferred to the caller.
    ///  This method starts the validity period of the sensor.
    /// @param _pID the pID EVM Hash gotten from pID
    function claimSensorNFT(bytes _pID) external payable;

    /// @notice Checks whether the sensor validity period expired
    /// @param _tokenId The identifier of the NFT
    /// @return True if the expiration period is greater than
    ///  the current height
    function isValid(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (bool);
}

interface IERC721 {
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);

    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);

    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);

    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

### Sensor validity

The sensor NFT validity acts as a way of constraining outdated (or not active) sensors. Each sensor has to have a expiration time (calculated in block height). When the current block height reaches the expiration block, the sensor is considered to be inactive. The end-user can renew the sensor by paying a fee proportional to the specified `expirationBlock` parameter.

### Front-running attack

When the device owner gets the sensor physically, he needs to claim the NFT by calling the `claim` method with the PID from the device's QR code.

A malicious observer looking at the pending TX pool can spot the claim transaction with the correct PID and replay the transaction with a higher gas price, effectively stealing the NFT from the original owner.

One potential way of preventing this is to implement a proper pre-commit scheme.

An implementer can introduce a `commitment` method which maps the `msg.sender` to a precommit hash:

`mapping(address => bytes) commitments;`

The precommit hash could be `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(PID, msg.sender))`.

Afterwards, when `claim` gets called, the method checks if there exists a matching hash for the given msg.sender.

```solidity
function claimDevice(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _expirationBlock, bytes _pid) {
    bytes commitment = commitments[msg.sender];
    bytes hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_pid, msg.sender));
    require(commitment == hash);
    ...
}
```
