# MEP-801: ISO Application Contract

## Simple Summary

Specification allowing users to create ISO applications on-chain.

## Abstract

ISO applications are projects that enable the caller to create ISOs (Initial Sensor Offerings). The applications created on this contract prove that the ownership of a particular sensor application belongs to the transaction signer.

An on-chain application links a given ISO project with the set of smart contracts deployed afterwards.

## Motivation

The goal is to allow the setup of an ISO applications.

## Terminology

- ISO Application - A project which the Business owner creates in order to start a ISO (Initial Sensor Offering), create devices and device profiles


## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every MEP-801 compliant contract must implement the following interface:

```solidity=
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

/// @title MEP-01 ISO Application Contract
interface IMEP801 {
    /// @dev This event gets emitted when a new application is created.
    ///  The parameters are the id, owner and the application name
    event CreateApplication(uint256 indexed _tenantId, uint256 indexed _appId, address indexed _owner, string _name);
    
    /// @notice Creates a new ISO application
    /// @param _name The name of the application
    function createApplication(string _name) external;
    
    /// @notice Change the owner of the application
    /// @param _newOwner The address of the new owner of the application
    function changeOwner(address _newOwner) external {}
}

```

## Rationale

To create an application in ISO Application, the caller needs to use the `createApplication` method.

The `createApplication` method needs to store the application name on-chain,
